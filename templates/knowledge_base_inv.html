            <h3 class="text-muted">WHY SHOULD YOU INVEST IN STARTUPS?</h3>
            <p class="fs-5">
              ​Many of those who fund startups do so for several reasons: few
              feel moral obligation, few do it because they genuinely believe in
              the concept, few take pride in what they do, few do it to
              diversify their portfolio and most to gain personal wealth.
              Yeah... if you invest wisely, you can make profit on your
              investment if the company grows and becomes more successful.
              <br />
              We recommend, invest only in what you love and understand (/you've
              expertise in). If you don’t understand it, it may be a bad idea to
              invest. <br />
              Investing should not be solely about earning a return. To invest
              in something as risky as a startup, you need more than conviction.
              It’s pretty cool to learn about future industries when founders
              post updates.​​

              We look for 'Spark' + 'Awww' factor. It's our promise, every
              company you would see here on Pepcorns would be of next generation
              (driving innovation). You can expect anything and everything from

              Once you make an investment, funds will be held in an escrow

              While building Pepcorns, our focus was on democratizing the
              startup funding with fast transaction deal flows. Traditional
              funding deals take months to finalize and execute. And so, we have
              made the process 'simple and minimal' with all necessary
              compliances.

            <h3 class="text-muted">WHAT ARE S.A.F.E NOTES?</h3>
            <p class="fs-5">
              A SAFE is a popular method to invest in early-stage companies. At
              its core, it’s an agreement – an investor puts money into a
              startup today and both parties agree that, in the future, that
              money can convert into stock. ​Y Combinator created SAFE back in
              2013, and first time adopted in India by Mumbai based VC firm
              100X.VC in 2019. ​Early-stage startups use SAFEs to delay the
              arduous task of determining company valuation. This is also a less
              complicated and much cheaper option than expensive equity rounds,
              which might take months of deal negotiation - execution, and
              serious money. The number of shares you receive is determined at
              the next priced financing when professional investors – typically
              venture capitalists – set the price for preferred stock. Then,
              calculated by using the Valuation Cap and sometimes the Discount
              Rate, your SAFE often converts into shares at a lower price than
              the venture capitalists paid, since you invested earlier.​ ​Unlike
              traditional Convertible Note, SAFEs are not a loan. As such, it
              does not accrue interest, have a maturity date, or have a legal
              obligation to be paid back. This makes it a simpler and cheaper
              way to fund a startup, and it aligns better with the interests of
              most early-stage equity investors who never wanted to be lenders
              (after all, convertible notes are rarely, if ever, repaid in cash
              - the startup goes bankrupt).

            <h3 class="text-muted">HOW S.A.F.E NOT WORKS ON PEPCORNS</h3>
            <p class="fs-5">
              ​Investors using the SAFE get a financial stake in the company.
              Investments are converted to equity when the company raises its
              next round. If the company doesn't raise the next round, the
              investment would be converted into shares after two years(2 yrs).

            <p class="fs-4">
              Super early-stage startups use SAFE notes(Simple Agreement for
              Future Equity). These will convert your investment to stock at a
              later date if the company raises a "priced round" from major
              investors, most often venture capitalists. At this point, you are
              a shareholder owning equity, and you earn a return if the value of
              that stock goes up over time, and you are able to sell it.

            <p class="fs-4">
              ​​​​​​​​​If your reward is not equity, you get your rewards, as

            <strong>Risk note:</strong> Your investment may never return if no

              An investment brings you return if a certain trigger event occurs,
              such as an acquisition, an IPO, or buyback. Trigger events
              sometimes occur sooner, but most don't occur for 4-6 years, and
              some ​may ​take even longer.​ Startups are​​ illiquid, and so
              finding new buyers is challenging. <br />
              It took Ashish Gupta 9 years in Flipkart, ​and ​Infoedge 10 years

              Straight answer is Vaulation. The post money valuation of your
              invested amount in startup, determines your return. <br />
              A company's valuation aims to estimate its worth in the broader
              sense, and the value of a company can be determined by looking at
              many factors, such as the number of founders, business moat,
              potential growth trends, assets owned, cash flow, customer
              acquisition rate, and many more.

                <strong>Illiquidity:</strong> There is a possibility that you
                will need to hold your investment indefinitely. Unlike investing
                in public listed companies on the stock exchange, buying-selling
                shares could be hard. Finding buyers in the private market could

                each funding round, this is healthy and normal.

                the success of a startup, early-stage companies often rely on

              You are more likely to avoid losses by diversifying your
              investments, focusing on areas in which you have the expertise,
              and investing in startups whose products you strongly believe in.
              Even professional investors have a difficult time predicting
              exactly how startups will earn money in the future (e.g., Google
              in 1999). Investing in what you know and find personally valuable
              is an important signal of a good investment.
