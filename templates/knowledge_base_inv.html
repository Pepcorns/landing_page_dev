          <h2><strong>Why should you invest in Startups?</strong></h2>
          <p>
            ‚ÄãMany of those who fund startups do so for several reasons: few feel
            moral obligation, few do it because they genuinely believe in the
            concept, few take pride in what they do, few do it to diversify
            their portfolio and most to gain personal wealth. Yeah... if you
            invest wisely, you can make profit on your investment if the company
            grows and becomes more successful. <br />
            We recommend, invest only in what you love and understand (/you've
            expertise in). If you don‚Äôt understand it, it may be a bad idea to
            invest. <br />
            Investing should not be solely about earning a return. To invest in
            something as risky as a startup, you need more than conviction. It‚Äôs
            pretty cool to learn about future industries when founders post
            updates.‚Äã‚Äã
          </p>

          <h2>
            <strong>What sorts of companies you would be investing in?</strong>
          </h2>
          <p>
            We look for 'Spark' + 'Awww' factor. It's our promise, every company
            you would see here on Pepcorns would be of next generation (driving
            innovation). You can expect anything and everything from medicines
            to pizza, from dog wellness products to cat shampoo, from space
            ships to red planet hotel chains, from robots to the next big
            crypto, everything is on the horizon.
          </p>

          <h2>
            <strong>How much can I invest?</strong>
          </h2>
          <p>
            ‚ÄãNow anybody can invest in their favourite startup, starting with as
            little as ‚Çπ1000. This token size varies depending on your risk
            appetite, sky is the limit.
          </p>

          <h2><strong>What happen to the funds after you invest</strong></h2>
          <p>
            Once you make an investment, funds will be held in an escrow
            account. The funds will be released from this account to the company
            after the campaign ends.
          </p>

          <h2><strong>How perks, rewards, and equity works?</strong></h2>
          <p>
            ‚ÄãEverything you invest in is aligned with rewards and benefits.
            Rewards include premium membership, early access deals and more. If
            you are HNIs‚Äã(Accredited), you may directly invest in equity.
            Investors, those who could not invest directly in equity, we invest
            a little chunk for them, which is distributed among all investors
            when we exit.
            <i> <strong> Yeah... reward bhi profit bhi!</strong> </i>

            While building Pepcorns, our focus was on democratizing the startup
            funding with fast transaction deal flows. Traditional funding deals
            take months to finalize and execute. And so, we have made the
            process 'simple and minimal' with all necessary compliances.
            <br />

            Giving everyone access to startup investing, and levelling the

            drawn from the escrow account. Any rejected investments will be
            returned to the investor in full.

          <h1>SAFE Notes üìù</h1>
          <p class="text-muted fs-4">
            What the heck are SAFE(Simply Agreement for Future Equity)
          </p>
          <h2><strong>What are SAFE notes?</strong></h2>
          <p>
            A SAFE is a popular method to invest in early-stage companies. At
            its core, it‚Äôs an agreement ‚Äì an investor puts money into a startup
            today and both parties agree that, in the future, that money can
            convert into stock. ‚ÄãY Combinator created SAFE back in 2013, and
            first time adopted in India by Mumbai based VC firm 100X.VC in 2019.
            <br />
            ‚ÄãEarly-stage startups use SAFEs to delay the arduous task of
            determining company valuation. This is also a less complicated and
            much cheaper option than expensive equity rounds, which might take
            months of deal negotiation - execution, and serious money. <br />
            The number of shares you receive is determined at the next priced
            financing when professional investors ‚Äì typically venture
            capitalists ‚Äì set the price for preferred stock. Then, calculated by
            using the Valuation Cap and sometimes the Discount Rate, your SAFE
            often converts into shares at a lower price than the venture
            capitalists paid, since you invested earlier.‚Äã <br />
            ‚ÄãUnlike traditional Convertible Note, SAFEs are not a loan. As such,
            it does not accrue interest, have a maturity date, or have a legal
            obligation to be paid back. This makes it a simpler and cheaper way
            to fund a startup, and it aligns better with the interests of most
            early-stage equity investors who never wanted to be lenders (after
            all, convertible notes are rarely, if ever, repaid in cash - the
            startup goes bankrupt).
          </p>
          <h2><strong> How SAFE not works on Pepcorns</strong></h2>
          <p>
            ‚ÄãInvestors using the SAFE get a financial stake in the company.
            Investments are converted to equity when the company raises its next
            round. If the company doesn't raise the next round, the investment
            would be converted into shares after two years(2 yrs). Read more

            <strong>
              Your returns depend on the investment you make and the rewards you
              select.
            </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Super early-stage startups use SAFE notes(Simple Agreement for
            Future Equity). These will convert your investment to stock at a
            later date if the company raises a "priced round" from major
            investors, most often venture capitalists. At this point, you are a
            shareholder owning equity, and you earn a return if the value of
            that stock goes up over time, and you are able to sell it.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄãIf your reward is not equity, you get your rewards, as your
            commitment freezes. And in a later stage, you'll receive returns as
            the company offers EXIT.‚Äã‚Äã
          </p>
          <p class="alert alert-danger">
            <strong>Risk note:</strong> Your investment may never return if no
            exit occurs. Unless a triggering event occurs, the SAFE investments
            will not convert and the investor may lose the money.
          </p>
          <h2><strong>How long until I see a return?</strong></h2>
          <p>
            An investment brings you return if a certain trigger event occurs,
            such as an acquisition, an IPO, or buyback. Trigger events sometimes
            occur sooner, but most don't occur for 4-6 years, and some ‚Äãmay
            ‚Äãtake even longer.‚Äã Startups are‚Äã‚Äã illiquid, and so finding new
            buyers is challenging. <br />
            It took Ashish Gupta 9 years in Flipkart, ‚Äãand ‚ÄãInfoedge 10 years in
            Zomato for crazy EXIT.‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã
          </p>
          <h2><strong>‚ÄãHow is the return determined?</strong></h2>
          <p>
            Straight answer is Vaulation. The post money valuation of your
            invested amount in startup, determines your return. <br />
            A company's valuation aims to estimate its worth in the broader
            sense, and the value of a company can be determined by looking at
            many factors, such as the number of founders, business moat,
            potential growth trends, assets owned, cash flow, customer
            acquisition rate, and many more.

          <p>
            ‚Äã‚ÄãInvesting on Pepcorns is completely free, as Pepcorns charges fees
            to the companies seeking investment; or in case if it has to it may
            charge minimal for unavoidable charges. <br />
            <br />
            That being said, Pepcorns may charge its investors a commission of
            up to 3% for escrow agent, payment gateway, and compliance if not
            covered by the company. This fee will be charged to investors on top
            of the investment. Your total amount charged will be stated clearly
            on the investment form with processing fees (say, 2.5% processing
            fee).

            It is important to invest in accordance with your risk appetite,
            which should not negatively impact your daily life. Invest in what
            you have more than conviction. Every idea doesn't turn Google,
            Tesla, Zomato, or Byzus but indeed which win-wins big. Always
            diversify, don't put all your money in one company instead put small
            chunks in multiple.

            <li class="list-style">
              <strong>Illiquidity:</strong> There is a possibility that you will
              need to hold your investment indefinitely. Unlike investing in
              public listed companies on the stock exchange, buying-selling
              shares could be hard. Finding buyers in the private market could
              be challenging.
            </li>
            <li class="list-style">
              <strong>Ownership Dilution:</strong> Successful startups host many
              rounds of financings, all the way to an IPO. For each financing,
              the startup issues additional stock to the new investors. As long
              as the value of the company increases with each funding round,
              this is healthy and normal.
            </li>
            <li class="list-style">
              <strong>Speculative:</strong> Unlike an investment in a mature
              business, where there is a track record of revenue and income, the
              success of a startup, early-stage companies often rely on the
              development of a new product or services that may or may not find
              a market.
            </li>
            <li class="list-style">
              <strong>Fraud:</strong> Every registered company which raise on
              Pepcorns goes under strict scrutiny and checks, but there is no
              way to control others action.

              plan, offerings, updates, finance, and use of proceeds, among
              other information. It‚Äôs important to note that an early-stage
              company may be able to provide only limited information about its
              business plan and operations because of less resources.

            Make sure you review <strong> detailed Risks</strong> before you
            start Investing.
          </p>
          <h2><strong>‚ÄãHow can I decrease the risk?</strong></h2>
          <p>
            You are more likely to avoid losses by diversifying your
            investments, focusing on areas in which you have the expertise, and
            investing in startups whose products you strongly believe in. Even
            professional investors have a difficult time predicting exactly how
            startups will earn money in the future (e.g., Google in 1999).
            Investing in what you know and find personally valuable is an
            important signal of a good investment.
          </p>
          <h2><strong>How many investments should I make?</strong></h2>
          <p>
            You can invest as many you want unless this negatively impacts your
            life. We recommend making several small investments each year rather
            than one large one.
