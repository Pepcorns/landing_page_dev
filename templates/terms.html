                <strong> Investing in securities is risky.</strong> The
                securities offered on the Website are suitable only for
                prospective investors who are familiar with and willing to
                accept the high risks associated with private investments,
                including the risk of complete loss of your investment.
                Securities sold through the Platform are not publicly traded
                and, therefore, are illiquid. Depending on the type of offering,
                securities will be subject to restrictions on resale or transfer
                including holding period requirements. Investing in private
                placements requires high risk tolerance, low liquidity need, and
                long-term commitments. Users must be able to afford to lose
                their entire investment. Investment products are not insured,
                may lose value, and are not guaranteed by any bank or other
                person. The securities being offered have not been registered
                under the Securities Act, in reliance on the exemptions from
                registration described above, or under any state laws. Users
                must read each investment’s offering materials and transaction
                documents for more information and discuss any questions with
                each issuer entities directly prior to investing. No assurance
                can be given that any offering currently qualifies or will
                continue to qualify under one or more of such exemptions due to,
                among other things, the adequacy of disclosure and the manner of
                distribution, the existence of similar offerings in the past or
                in the future, or a change of any securities law or regulation
                that has retroactive effect. No governmental agency has reviewed
                the offerings posted on this Website and no state or federal
                agency has passed upon either the adequacy of the disclosure
                contained herein or the fairness of the terms of any offering.
                The exemptions relied upon for such offerings are significantly
                dependent upon the accuracy of the representations of the Users
                to be made to the Website and security issuers on the Website in
                connection with an offering. In the event that any such
                representations prove to be untrue, the registration exemptions
                relied upon by an issuer in selling the securities might not be
                available and substantial liability to such issuer would result
                under applicable securities laws for rescission or damages.
                These risks are non-exhaustive and are intended to highlight
                certain risks associated with investing in securities that are
                not registered with the SEBI. WE STRONGLY ADVISE YOU TO CONSULT
                A LEGAL, TAX AND/OR FINANCIAL PROFESSIONAL BEFORE INVESTING, AND
                CAREFULLY REVIEW ALL THE SPECIFIC RISK DISCLOSURES PROVIDED AS
                PART OF ANY OFFERING MATERIALS AND ASK THE ISSUER ANY QUESTIONS
                YOU MAY HAVE OR REQUEST ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.
