            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
              Pepcorns is a fundraising platform, through which startups can
              raise capital from their friends-family/customer/investor
              technically anybody. Until now, only the wealthiest < 1% fund
              startups. Everyone else was relegated to buying a product or
              donating money to support startups, but this now changes with
              'Pepcorns fair play'. Now, startups can access a far larger group
              of potential investors while rewarding them. These rewards even
              allow ownership in some cases and be part of the founders'
              exciting journey. <br />
              <br />
              We make funding your startup easier by guiding you through the
              process, handling most of the tedious paperwork, and coaching you
              to become a better fundraiser. <br />
              Our mission is to make this new financing avenue as simple and
              transparent as possible for companies and investors alike.

              Youâ€™re bringing people together who have common interests. As
              people invest, we help you solicit their feedback: Why did they
              invest? What are their concerns? How might they be a resource for
              your business? Perhaps theyâ€™re the expert that you need to get the
              next client or solve a patent problem youâ€™ve been worrying about.
              Through structured discussion on our platform, you can interact
              efficiently with your investors, and youâ€™ll always have a group of
              people to return to for help or, possibly, follow-on funding
              consideration. Learn more, how community can help your startup and
              why it is so important.

            <p class="fs-5">
              You can raise any amount up to 10 cr on Pepcorns in a particular
              financial year. Your campaign has two set goals (minimum and
              final). You can only withdraw money when you at least reach your
              minimum goal. This minimum goal needs to be achieved within 2
              months to qualify further for the final. We suggest raising
              achievable targets as you can change the final amount again in the
              future. The success of your raise will hugely depend on the
              quality of your campaign and traction.

            <h3 class="text-muted">HOW CAN I PROMOTE MY CAMPAIGN?</h3>
            <p class="fs-5">
              The easiest way to get lots of potential investors to your
              campaign page is to send traffic from the company's website to the
              campaign page. <br />
              You can do this in 2 ways and direct your user and visitor from
              your website to the campaign page:
            </p>

            <ul class="d-flex flex-column gap-2 list-style">
              <li class="list-style">
                POP-UP: Visiter may click the button to visit the campaign if
                interested.
              </li>
              <li class="list-style">
                URL Redirect: You change the website DNS to point to your
                campaign page URL.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <div class="d-flex flex-column gap-3">
            <p class="fs-3 text-muted">Social Media</p>
            <p class="fs-5">
              If in case you decide to run ads on social media, avoid hyperbole
              and misleading info. You can not write 'raising funds or anything
              like that' instead you can simply tell about the product and ask
              people to support you in building the future or reframe. Do not
              mention any future forecast related to company growth, tho' you
              can mention company expansion plans and future products. Always
              prefer the storytelling approach instead of directly asking for
              support. Try approaching influencers.

            <p class="fs-3 text-muted">Make strategy</p>
            <p class="fs-5">
              The key to a successful rising is managing momentum. The faster
              the investments come in, the more new investors would want to
              invest. The most important thing you can do is to plan a big first
              day. That "pop" can spark the entire fundraise. Prepare a list of
              all leads who love what you are doing. Write an authentic personal
              email or message to them.

              Fundraising takes a lot of effort â€” more so than simply posting a
              profile and waiting for the money to roll in. It involves
              independent marketing effort, hustle, and going out to ask people
              for contributions. Your fundraising goal should take into account
              how big your network is, how efficiently you put your deal in
              front of them, and finally how much people turn up to contribute
              to each reward. <br />
              What matters is the company's market presence and acceptance among
              the community.
